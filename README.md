# GuideMe
 Navigation App for the visually impaired people using Beacons
 
 GuideMe is a navigation app in its initial stage that helps visually impaired people to navigate through the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in Singapore. 
 Beacons would have to be implemented at important junctions of the station such as the entrance, escalator, barrier, etc.
 As the user approaches the beacons, a voice message along will be displayed alerting the user where he/she has reached.
 The image displayed would be of help for the partially blind people.
 
 Other features include setting up an emergency contact number which can be called on the press of a button and increasing or decreasing the brightness of the screen.
 
 The code is written in Swift 2 and uses SQlite database.
